###### I'll write this description as I go, sort of like a log of developments.

## This repo is for personal learning reasons, so heres what i'll be doing: 

I'll be practicing a bunch of coding in here.

For starters, i'll pick some beginner **javascript** coding challenges that [i found in a quick google search](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/10-javascript-code-challenges-for-beginners/), and add my own [little twist](# "Maybe add some new little features that i think of on the spot") to it.
