## Beginner coding challenges description:

### 1. Display even numbers

Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.

### 2. Create a length converter function

Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

### 3. Create a function that reverses an array

### 4. Sort an array from lowest to highest

### 5. Remove the spaces found in a string

### 6. Return the number of vowels in a string
