## Beginner coding challenges description:

### 1. Display even numbers

Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.

### 2. Create a length converter function

Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

### 3. Create a function that reverses an array

This challenge is particularly helpful if you’re planning to become a Data Scientist. Manipulating data is a significant part of the role, and building the foundations now will help you later down the road when you’re working with large databases.

Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, and then try your program with a larger array to verify its success.

### 4. Sort an array from lowest to highest

You could create a function for this solution as well, but be sure to try your program with varying lengths and types of arrays. Try one with all integers, another with negative numbers, and another with decimals.

### 5. Remove the spaces found in a string

Yet another way to clean up data is to remove any errors or unnecessary spaces. This function will take in a string and then return it with all spaces removed. Think about if you were tasked with cleaning up customer data at your job. You could scale this function to clean up specific fields of data, such as zip codes.

### 6. Return the number of vowels in a string

Create a function that’ll return an integer of the number of vowels found in a string. This is a great way to practice determining the features of a dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you’ll be well-prepared to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. If you feel like an extra challenge, consider returning the number of characters.
